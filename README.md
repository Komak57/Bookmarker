# Auto-tracking Manga, Anime, Movies

Selectively track domains for content pertinent to episode or chapter related media. The primary focus is Anime and Manga, but is expansive enough to cover TV series, movies, live streams and the like. Note, only Anime and Manga are compatible with the cross-platform features until an API can be added for other types of media. This extension does not add episodes or seasons to your browser bookmarks, but maintains the list exclusively in the extension and icon.

## Features

- **Track Anime, Manga, Movies and Other**
- **Access content across domains when both domains are tracked, and the same category.**
- **Automatically track an episode when watching episode 1.**
- **Force track any episode.**
- **Notify when watching an episode out of order (skipping).**
- **Mark episode as "Complete".**
- **Remove episodes.**
- **Share your progress across platforms (limited space, est 1000 actively watched episodes, anime/manga only).**
- **Pull contracted episode count, thumbnail, and English name for all Anime and Manga from JIKAN API. -- False positives can occur, but will not interfere with functionality**
- **Settings per-domain allow for robust matching methods, including URL, Tab Title, CSS Selector, and Regex.**
- **Export data to CSV**

### Additional Notes

> **NOTE**: No domain-specific settings have been added. All sites will track based on your per-domain settings only.
